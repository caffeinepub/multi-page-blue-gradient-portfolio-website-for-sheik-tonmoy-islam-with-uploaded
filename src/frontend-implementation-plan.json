        "In `frontend/src/index.css`, the global typography rule that applies `text-shadow` to elements (e.g., h1–h6, p, span, a, li, label, div[class*=\"text\"]) is removed or updated so `text-shadow` is not applied.",
        "No headings or body text on any page shows a text-shadow in the browser (verify at least Home, About, Services, Skills, Portfolio, Contact).",
        "The waterfall background and overlay remain unchanged and continue to sit behind all page content (no interaction blocking).",
        "Typography remains readable after shadow removal; if any text becomes hard to read, adjust only global color tokens (e.g., `--foreground`, `--muted-foreground`) rather than adding back shadows or page-specific overrides."
