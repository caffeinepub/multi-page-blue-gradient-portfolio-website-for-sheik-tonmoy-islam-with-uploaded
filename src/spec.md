# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new Law/Legal blog section (with image) to the Blog page using the existing blog card layout, and update Blog page SEO metadata to reflect the added content.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a fifth Blog page card/section for Law/Legal content, matching the existing blog section layout (English heading, short English description, and a static image with non-empty alt text).
- Add and reference a new Law/Legal themed image from an absolute path under `/assets/generated/` to match the existing blog image patterns.
- Update the Blog page SEO metadata (description and Open Graph description) to mention inclusion of Law/Legal content.
- Rebuild and republish so the update is live under the production identifier `sheik-tonmoy-islam`.

**User-visible outcome:** The Blog page displays five sections total, including a new Law/Legal card with an image, and the live site reflects the update without broken images.
