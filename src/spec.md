# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix header readability by adding proper contrast between text and background across all devices.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a dark background color to the header section in HeaderNav.tsx
- Ensure 'Sheik Tonmoy Islam' name text has sufficient contrast against the dark background
- Ensure all navigation menu items are clearly visible with proper contrast
- Verify header displays correctly and remains readable on mobile (320px+), tablet, and desktop viewports
- Maintain sticky header behavior and mobile sheet menu functionality

**User-visible outcome:** The header section will have a dark background that makes all text (site name and navigation menu items) clearly readable on all device sizes, fixing the current white-on-white readability issue.
