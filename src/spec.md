# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the /contact page styling so the Contact Information section renders in white text while the contact form renders in black text on its light background, without changing the page header.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust Contact Information section styles so its heading and all Email/Location/WhatsApp labels and values/links display in white, while keeping email/WhatsApp links functional.
- Adjust Contact form styles so the form title/description, field labels, and user-entered input/textarea text display in black.
- Ensure validation errors and submit success/error messages remain readable and behavior stays unchanged (no backend changes).

**User-visible outcome:** On the Contact page, the Contact Information card text is white and the form text (labels and typed input) is black, with the “Get In Touch” header unchanged and links/submission working as before.
