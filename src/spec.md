# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace meter-only Skills listings with detailed, readable skill descriptions (with images) and surface the same “Skills Details” content on the Portfolio page.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Skills page to show five written skill sections with headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists: Legal Skills (short summary), Digital Marketing (short summary), Graphics Design (detailed), Video Editing (basic but detailed), and WordPress Website Design (detailed, WordPress only).
- Ensure the written Skills content includes the requested items (e.g., legal areas like land/crime/tax; digital marketing tasks like Facebook page setup/optimization, scheduling, ads, social media management, SEO/SMM; graphics design deliverables; basic video editing tasks; WordPress site design/build categories), all in English.
- Add one static image per skill category on the Skills page, rendered alongside its section/card with meaningful English alt text and responsive layout behavior.
- Add a “Skills Details” section below the Portfolio projects grid that reuses the same detailed skill content and the same five images (kept consistent with the Skills page).

**User-visible outcome:** The Skills page shows clear, English descriptions (not just meters) for five skill categories with a relevant image for each, and the Portfolio page includes a new “Skills Details” section below the projects grid showing the same detailed skills and images.
