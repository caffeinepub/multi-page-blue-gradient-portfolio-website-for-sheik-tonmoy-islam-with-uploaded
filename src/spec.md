# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the About page styling so only the “What Sets Me Apart” InfoCards display black text, without affecting any other text on the About page or other routes.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust styling for the InfoCard title and description within the “What Sets Me Apart” section on `/about` to render black text.
- Ensure About page biography/body text and headings retain their existing colors and are not overridden.
- Scope the styling change to `/about` only, avoiding side effects on other pages.

**User-visible outcome:** On the About page, the “What Sets Me Apart” InfoCards show black titles and descriptions, while all other About page text remains unchanged.
