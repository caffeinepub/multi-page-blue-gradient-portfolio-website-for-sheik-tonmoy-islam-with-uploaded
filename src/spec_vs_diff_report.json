SEO metadata strings were also updated to mention Law/Legal. However, the required new image asset is not shown as added anywhere in the diff summary, and there is no verifiable evidence of an actual rebuild/republish occurring under the production identifier.",

      "reason": "The Blog page references /assets/generated/blog-law-legal.dim_1200x800.png, but the diff summary shows no added files and does not show the image being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the asset inclusion cannot be verified and may result in a broken image.",
