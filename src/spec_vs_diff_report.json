  "summary": "REQ-114 is not correctly implemented. The diff introduces global CSS changes and About-page biography overrides that alter text colors beyond the \"What Sets Me Apart\" InfoCards, and it also appears to apply black-text overrides to other pages/sections (e.g., Services/Portfolio/Contact per summaries), violating the requirement to scope changes only to those InfoCards on /about while keeping all other About text unchanged and avoiding side effects on other routes.",

      "id": "REQ-114",
      "requirement": "Only the InfoCards in the \"What Sets Me Apart\" section on /about should render black text (title + description), while all other About page text (biography/body + headings) keeps existing colors, and no other routes are affected.",
      "reason": "The diff explicitly forces the About biography/body text to pure white via global CSS overrides, which changes existing styling rather than keeping it unchanged. Additionally, the repository summaries indicate black text overrides were applied to other pages (Services/Portfolio/Contact), which violates the requirement that no other pages/routes have text color changes as a side-effect.",
