  "summary": "Implemented white-text override for the Contact Information section and added text color classes throughout the contact form, but the form does not explicitly set text to black as required (it uses theme tokens like `text-foreground`/`text-muted-foreground`, which may not guarantee black).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-123",
      "requirement": "Update the Contact form UI so the form area uses black text (title/description, labels, and user-entered input/textarea text) while preserving existing validation and submit status behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the form using theme token classes (`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`) rather than explicit black text classes. This may not guarantee black text on a white/light form background as required. The textarea portion is also truncated, so explicit black text for typed textarea content is not verifiable from the provided diff.",
