  "summary": "The diff updates the Portfolio image gallery component and begins updating project image data to use new /assets/generated/ v2 image paths with English alt text. However, the diff summary provides no evidence that the 120 required image files were added under frontend/public/assets/generated/, and some requirements cannot be fully verified due to truncation (e.g., all 10 projects having exactly 12 images, and thumbnail fit behavior). Additionally, two non-requested metadata/state files were modified.",

      "id": "REQ-133",
      "requirement": "Add exactly 120 new generated image files (12 per each of the 10 existing projects) under frontend/public/assets/generated/ with the exact specified filenames.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added files and does not list any new static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated/, so there is no evidence the 120 image files were actually added to the repo.",

      "reason": "The shown portion confirms one project has 12 images and uses /assets/generated/... with English alt text, but the file is truncated and does not provide evidence for all 10 projects having exactly 12 images nor that non-image fields remain unchanged across all entries.",

      "reason": "The main image uses object-contain and includes normalizeAssetPath + fallback handling, but the thumbnail <img> portion is truncated, so there is no evidence that thumbnails specifically use a non-cropping fit behavior.",
