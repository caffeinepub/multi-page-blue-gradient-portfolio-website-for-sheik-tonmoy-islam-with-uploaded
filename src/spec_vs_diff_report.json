  "summary": "Diff makes progress toward image removal by switching HeroSection to a CSS gradient and replacing header/footer logo imagery with text-only branding. However, evidence suggests portrait components may still render images, and there is no diff evidence of an actual republish/deploy under the production identifier.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Remove all pictures/images so that no <img> elements render anywhere across all pages, including portraits, logos, and decorative background images; ensure no broken-image/empty frames remain and layout stays balanced.",
      "reason": "The diff summary indicates a portrait component still supports/uses image loading (suggesting an <img> still exists), which would violate the \"no <img> anywhere\" acceptance criteria. The diff also does not provide evidence that all pages/components were audited to remove every <img>.",

      "reason": "Portrait-related components and portrait config file are still present and were modified. The diff summary does not show they were removed/disabled or that imports/usages were eliminated from all routes/components.",
