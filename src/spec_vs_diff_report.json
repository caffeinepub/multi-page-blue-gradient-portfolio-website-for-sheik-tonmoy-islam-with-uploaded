  "summary": "The diff clearly updates the Portfolio project card UI to include an external link icon opening in a new tab with safe rel attributes, and it updates the static projects dataset. However, due to truncation of `frontend/src/data/projects.ts` and lack of visibility into the Portfolio page/filtering components in this diff, several acceptance criteria cannot be conclusively verified from the provided evidence.",
