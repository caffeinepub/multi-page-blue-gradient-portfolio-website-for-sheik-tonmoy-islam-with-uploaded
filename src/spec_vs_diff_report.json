  "summary": "All four requirements have been successfully implemented in the HeaderNav.tsx component. The header now features a dark slate background (bg-slate-900/95) with proper contrast for white text, ensuring readability of the name 'Sheik Tonmoy Islam' and all navigation menu items across all device sizes. The changes preserve the sticky header behavior, mobile sheet menu functionality, and active route highlighting as specified in the constraints.",
