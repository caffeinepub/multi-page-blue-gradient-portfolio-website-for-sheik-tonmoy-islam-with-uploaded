REQ-52 is only partially evidenced: the UI renders images via static paths and alt text, but the diff summary does not show the required image asset files being added to the frontend static assets.",

      "requirement": "Create/provide one static frontend image asset per skill category (Legal, Digital Marketing, Graphics Design, Video Editing, WordPress Website Design) and render them alongside content with proper alt text.",
      "reason": "The code references image paths under \"/assets/generated/...png\" and provides alt text, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added to the repository/static assets. Without the files, the images may 404 and would not satisfy the requirement to create and serve the visuals as static frontend assets.",
